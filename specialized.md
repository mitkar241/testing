# Specialized Testing
---
Functional testing and non-functional testing come together as part of an organization’s essential quality assurance process. The goal of these functional testing types is not only to confirm functionality, but also a good user experience. However, the scale and scope of testing often make this task more challenging than it sounds.

Here at Community, we not only offer solutions and expertise for the above functional testing types, we help our customers confirm they can meet particular revenue-driving quality objectives. These specialized tests involve multiple types of functional tests all geared toward a specific type of feature or service, such as payment processing and accessibility conformance.

Community caters testing to unique customer requirements and constantly evolves testing offerings. Here are several types of specialized testing programs that Community provides:

- [Accessibility testing](#accessibility-testing)
- [AI testing](#ai-testing)
- [Customer journey testing](#customer-testing)
- [Payment testing](#payment-testing)
- [Roaming testing](#roaming-testing)
- [Security testing](#security-testing)
- [User experience testing](#user-experience-testing)
- [Voice testing](#voice-testing)

## Accessibility testing
---
Your digital products need to work for all users, not just a subset of users. That makes accessibility testing a must for all organizations. Companies that comply with federal accessibility standards open up additional revenue channels and reduce the risk of lawsuits.

Community provides accessibility audits and guidance to assess whether your digital product is easy to use and inclusive for all users regardless of disability or impairment. With a team assessing your entire site, you receive a comprehensive breakdown of designs and features that must be updated to meet current standards and regulations. Community helps organizations with continual maintenance checks, as well as course development and training to ensure you’re up to code — and stay that way.

## AI testing
---
A lot of work — and data — goes into training machine learning algorithms. But it doesn’t stop there. AI testing against a variety of criteria ensures that AI and ML systems function as expected.

Community provides AI training and testing, with the latter focusing on the quality of these systems. Community experts can provide a real user’s perspective, testing for devices where the system will run and check against AI bias. Without proper training and testing, it’s hard to realize the value of AI and ML — take the time to do it right.

## Customer journey testing
---
Nearly every company connects with consumers across multiple channels (e.g. mobile, web, social, in-store). Thus, customer journey testing, or omnichannel testing, is essential to the end-to-end experience. Customer journey testing uses real people to test an experience from one channel to another to ensure consistent digital quality and continuity of experience.

The community of experts helps brands achieve cross-functional alignment and smooth customer experiences. Take advantage of testers in the markets and demographics you need, and receive actionable feedback to reduce customer friction.

## Payment testing
---
For any transactional system, payment testing is critical to success. With payment testing, users validate select payment methods, such as credit cards, debit cards, mobile wallets and P2P platforms. Payment testing ensures that currency can seamlessly change hands from the consumer to the business and a transaction can be processed.

Community conducts payment testing with real users around the world, in different currencies for both digital and physical transactions. When it comes to financial transactions, it’s not good enough to simply hope the payment processes. Ensure your revenue stream works as it should with payment testing.

## Roaming testing
---
When you apply the above types of functional testing in one location, remember that there’s no guarantee the app will — or should — perform the same way in another location. In today’s increasingly mobile world, developers and testers must make sure devices perform well across international boundaries and under varying network conditions.

Turn to community for expertise in roaming testing. Our digital experts help you test mobile functionality or user experience across many device/OS combinations. Whether you want to collect market-specific feedback, customize tests for network changes or ensure readiness for a new launch, Community has the expertise to make it happen.

## Security testing
---
All apps and websites require robust security to maintain consumer trust and protect both data and intellectual property. There are numerous automated scans and assessments that every company should perform as part of security testing, but active testing elements should bring the human side into testing as well.

Community provides a global team of white-hat hackers to penetration test your digital products. These penetration testers attempt to break into your protected system to identify vulnerabilities. Community provides these insights securely within our platform and offers a breadth of knowledge and experience to give peace of mind that a release meets high security standards.

## User experience testing
---
Contrary to user acceptance testing, user experience testing considers user opinions. It’s important to have functional digital products, but it’s also crucial to have products that customers can easily use — and, ideally, like to use.

Community conducts user experience testing led by a qualified UX researcher and run through our global community of experts based on your customer profiles. You can run various types of studies to collect detailed user feedback that helps identify areas or features that could be adjusted to improve the user experience.

## Voice testing
---
As devices evolve, so do the mechanisms through which users interact with them. Voice applications bring a new level of complexity to software testing because of the numerous variables associated with the human voice. Voice testing enlists real people to test inputs across a wide range of languages, dialects, emotional states, and more.

Ensure that users everywhere can understand — and be understood by — your digital products through voice testing with Community. Our global community can validate that voice inputs work as expected and outputs are helpful and accurate.
