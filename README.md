## Specialized and Functional Testing Types
---
In software testing, the big picture often overshadows the individual details. To fully optimize quality assurance efforts, teams must understand the various types of functional and specialty testing. Knowing when to use techniques like unit testing, integration testing and system testing is essential to releasing high-quality software products.

Once the team grasps these functional testing types, it can allocate time and resources where appropriate. It's difficult to achieve a high percentage of test coverage, even when the team takes advantage of automated and manual testing. These types of functional tests help organizations ensure digital products meet requirements from the code level all the way up to the system as a whole. Spread testing throughout the software development life cycle — and apply it continuously — to release high-quality products that deliver a positive user experience.

Organizations looking to boost quality can also deploy some specialized testing techniques that include a mix of different non-functional and functional testing types designed around a particular kind of platform. Community specializes in digital testing programs geared toward a particular platform or purpose. These testing programs incorporate various functional tests to achieve exceptional results.

First, we'll discuss how various types of functional tests come together in an overall strategy, then we’ll dig into each one.

## Software testing strategy

The ultimate goal of functional testing is to ensure that software works according to specifications and in line with user expectations. While the objective sounds simple, the task involves many functional testing types, some of which might be preferred or prioritized over others depending on the nature of the application and organization.

For example, functional testing types like component, integration and system testing validate the ability to work in isolation or with other components, so the testing strategy might depend on how interoperable the app must be. Similarly, if an organization performs system testing, it might not perform acceptance testing, as that work might be considered redundant. Another example: alpha, beta and production testing all describe builds that are in a production environment. Your choice between these functional testing types — or how the scale of people involved in each stage — might depend on the stability of the app, the scope of the changes, or timelines set by the business.

The following functional testing types, therefore, are neither intended to be used sequentially nor for every application. Consider the advantages and disadvantages of each type of functional test, as well as the time and resources available to commit to QA.
